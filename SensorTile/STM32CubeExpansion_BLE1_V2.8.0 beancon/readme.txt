The X-CUBE-BLE1 is an expansion software package for STM32Cube.
The software runs on the STM32 and includes drivers for ST’s
BlueNRG Bluetooth Low Energy device. The expansion is built on
STM32Cube software technology to ease portability across different
STM32 microcontrollers. The software comes with examples of
implementation of the drivers running on the X-NUCLEO-IDB04A1 or 
X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1, when connected to an STM32 NUCLEO.

For the content of this package, the development toolchains and compilers
to use and the supported devices and evaluation boards, refer to the
Release Notes in the root directory of this package.

The simplest way to start using this expansion software is to run the
sample applications in Projects\Multi\Applications.
The readme.txt included in the Applications folder provides the
description of all applications and the instructions on how to run them.
