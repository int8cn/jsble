@par Example Description 

This sample application shows how to use BlueNRG Bluetooth Low Energy 
stack and to measure the application throughput.
To test this application you need two STM32 Nucleo boards with their
respective BlueNRG STM32 expansion boards. One board needs to be configured
as Server-Peripheral role, while the other needs to be configured as Client-Central
role.
Before flashing the boards, please make sure to use the right configuration by selecting
it from the menu options of the toolchain.

Selecting the "SampleApp_*" configurations allows to target the SampleApp.
 - Program the CLIENT on one STM32 Nucleo board, with BlueNRG STM32 expansion board,
   and reset it (configuration: SampleApp_CLIENT). 
 - Program the SERVER on a second STM32 Nucleo board, with BlueNRG STM32 expansion
   board, and reset it (configuration: SampleApp_SERVER). 
 - After establishing the connection between the two boards (when the LED2 on the
   CLIENT turns off),
   by pressing the USER button on one board, the LD2 LED on the other one gets toggled
   and viceversa.
   No serial terminal emulator must be open since no throughput test is performed.
 - If you have only one STM32 Nucleo board, you can program it as SERVER and use as CLIENT
   the BLE IOT app for Android devices available on the Play Store at
   https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stmicro.bleiot 

Selecting the "ThroughputTest_*" configurations allows to perform a throughput test.
 - Program the CLIENT on one STM32 Nucleo board, with BlueNRG STM32 expansion board,
   and reset it (configuration: ThroughputTest_CLIENT).
   The platform will be seen on the PC as a virtual COM port. Open the port in a serial terminal emulator
   (Word Length = 8 Bits, Stop Bit = One Stop bit, Parity = ODD parity, BaudRate = 9600 baud,
   Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)).
 - Program the SERVER on a second STM32 Nucleo board, with BlueNRG STM32 expansion
   board, and reset it (configuration: ThroughputTest_SERVER).
   The two boards will try to establish a connection.
 - During the connection and characteristics discovery phase the LED2 on the CLIENT
   is ON.
   Once the connection between the two boards is established, the LED2 on the CLIENT turns OFF.
 - The throughput test can be started by pressing the USER button on the the Server-Peripheral board.
   The Server-Peripheral will continuously send notifications of 20 bytes to the Client-Central.
 - After every 500 packets, the measured application throughput will be displayed on the terminal emulator.  
 - IMPORTANT NOTE: To avoid issues with USB connection (mandatory if you have USB 3.0), it is   
   suggested to update the ST-Link/V2 firmware for STM32 Nucleo boards to the latest version.
   Please refer to the readme.txt file in the Applications directory for details.
 - WARNING: When using the NUCLEO-L053R8 boards the Throughput test may fails. No problem occurs
   when using NUCLEO-F401RE or NUCLEO-L476RG boards.
 
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32 Nucleo devices with BlueNRG STM32 expansion board
    (X-NUCLEO-IDB04A1 or X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1)
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    - NUCLEO-L053R8 RevC board
    - NUCLEO-F401RE RevC board
    - NUCLEO-L476RG RevC board
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    This example runs also on the NUCLEO-F411RE RevC board, even if the chip could
    be not exploited at its best since the projects are configured for the
    NUCLEO-F401RE target board.
    

@par How to use it? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with
   Embedded Workbench V7.50.3).
   Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with V5.22).
   Alternatively you can use the System Workbench for STM32 (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with Version 1.12.0).
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
   folder included in the distributed package.
